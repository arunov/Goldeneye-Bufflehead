Goldeneye Bufflehead Security
-----------------------------
By Arun Olappamanna Vasudevan

This is a role based access control mechanism.

Kernel module
-------------
(1) Copy this folder to security/ in kernel source code
(2) Add following lines in security/Makefile
subdir-$(CONFIG_SECURITY_GEBH)      += gebh
obj-$(CONFIG_SECURITY_GEBH)     += gebh/built-in.o
(3) Add following line in security/Kconfig
source security/gebh/Kconfig
(4) Add following line in .config
CONFIG_SECURITY_GEBH=y

files in /etc/
--------------
gebh_role_id: List of role names and ids
gebh_user_role: User name and roles that user is authorized to take
gebh_policy: Role id and inodes that are authorized to use
gebh_active_role: User id and role id that user is currently active in

Managing files in /etc
----------------------
(1) Move gebh_manager.py to /sbin/
(2) gebh_manager.py --help

Admin mode
----------
root is treated as admin

Limitations
-----------
- You don't directly get to use a folder that you create as a non-admin user
- gebh_active_role is a accessible to all users
- If a dir is removed, it is not removed from policy file <- could lead to exploits
- File parsing is done in kernel module - considered a very bad practice
- Design did not consider performance into consideration
- There is no way folders added can be listed. Only inode numbers can be found in /etc/gebh_policy
